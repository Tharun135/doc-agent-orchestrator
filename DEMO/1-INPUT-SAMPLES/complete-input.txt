Login Authentication Process

The homepage displays a login form with two fields: username and password. There is a blue "Sign In" button below the fields.

When the user enters their username and password and clicks the Sign In button, the system validates the credentials against the user database.

If the credentials are valid, the system redirects the user to the main dashboard at /dashboard. The dashboard displays a welcome message with the user's name.

If the credentials are invalid, the system displays a red error message below the Sign In button that reads "Invalid username or password. Please try again."

Admin users see an additional "Admin Panel" link in the top navigation bar after successful login. Regular users do not see this link.

The login form has client-side validation that prevents submission if either field is empty.
