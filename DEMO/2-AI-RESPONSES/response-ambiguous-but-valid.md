# AI RESPONSE - Ambiguous But Valid Input

## (Preserved ambiguity without blocking)

Input was vague but documentable without inventing behavior.

---

## Prerequisites

- Access to the login button

## Procedure

1. Click the login button.
2. The system checks your credentials.
3. If valid, you are redirected to the dashboard.
4. If invalid, an error message is displayed.

## Notes

- Admin users receive additional options. The specific options available depend on your admin permissions.

## ✅ WHY THIS IS EXCELLENT

**Preserved ambiguity without inventing:**

- ✅ "Login button" (didn't invent label like "Sign In")
- ✅ "Checks credentials" (didn't specify username/password)
- ✅ "Redirected to dashboard" (didn't invent URL)
- ✅ "Error message" (didn't invent text or styling)
- ✅ "Additional options" (didn't list invented admin features)

**No blocking questions:**

- The task was completable as-is
- Ambiguity preserved: "additional options depend on your permissions"
- User gets usable documentation immediately

**No invented features:**

- ❌ No "Remember Me" checkbox
- ❌ No "Forgot Password" link
- ❌ No specific error messages
- ❌ No made-up admin panel features

**Result: Accurate documentation that preserves source ambiguity.**
