---

## Prerequisites
- Valid username and password credentials
- Access to the homepage

## Procedure

1. Navigate to the homepage.
2. Enter your username in the username field.
3. Enter your password in the password field.
4. Click the **Sign In** button.

The system validates your credentials against the user database and redirects you to the main dashboard at `/dashboard`. A welcome message displays with your name.

## Notes

- If either field is empty, client-side validation prevents form submission.
- If credentials are invalid, a red error message displays below the Sign In button: "Invalid username or password. Please try again."
- Admin users will see an additional **Admin Panel** link in the top navigation bar after successful login. Regular users do not see this link.
- The Sign In button is blue.
