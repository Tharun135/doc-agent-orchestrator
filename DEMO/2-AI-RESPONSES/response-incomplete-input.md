# AI RESPONSE - Truly Incomplete Input

## (Blocked by undefined references)

Input had undefined terms that force invention.

## MISSING INFORMATION

I cannot generate documentation because the source contains undefined references that would require inventing behavior:

**Undefined References:**

1. **"Standard workflow"**
   - What is the standard workflow?
   - What specific steps does it include?
   - Where is this workflow defined?

2. **"Appropriate action"**
   - What specific action does the system take?
   - Does it:
     - Redirect somewhere?
     - Display a message?
     - Update data?
     - Trigger a process?

**Why I'm asking:**

- Without knowing what "standard workflow" and "appropriate action" mean, I would have to invent the actual behavior
- This violates the governance rule against inventing features

**Please provide:**

- Definition of "standard workflow" with specific steps
- Description of what "appropriate action" means in this context

## ✅ WHY THIS IS CORRECT

**These are truly blocking:**

- ❌ "Standard workflow" - undefined reference
- ❌ "Appropriate action" - no concrete behavior specified
- ❌ Cannot document without inventing the actual process

**This is different from ambiguity** (which can be preserved)
