# Getting Started with Documentation Agent Orchestrator

## 🚀 5-Minute Quick Start

### Step 1: Have Some Content Ready

Any rough notes or existing documentation:
- Jira tickets
- Meeting notes
- Code comments
- Slack messages
- Incomplete specs

### Step 2: Select Your Content

- Highlight the text in VS Code
- Or open a file containing your content

### Step 3: Generate the Prompt

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
2. Type: `Generate Documentation Prompt`
3. Select it from the list

### Step 4: Choose Documentation Type

Pick what you're creating:
- **Procedure** - Step-by-step instructions
- **Concept** - Explanations of how something works
- **Troubleshooting** - Problem-solving guides

### Step 5: Describe Your Intent

Type a brief description:
- "Document the login flow"
- "Explain the caching system"
- "Troubleshoot deployment failures"

### Step 6: Use the Generated Prompt

The prompt opens in a new tab and is automatically copied to your clipboard.

**Paste it into:**
- Claude (Anthropic)
- ChatGPT (OpenAI)
- GitHub Copilot Chat
- Any AI assistant

### Step 7: Get Your Documentation

The AI will respond with either:
- ✅ Structured documentation (if info is sufficient)
- ❓ Clarifying questions (if critical info is missing)

### Step 8 (Optional): Preview Changes

If you're revising existing docs:
1. Paste AI output into a new file
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
3. Run: `Preview Documentation Rewrite Diff`
4. See side-by-side comparison

## 🎯 What Makes This Different?

### Without This Extension:
AI often invents features, changes terminology, and adds "helpful" details you never mentioned.

### With This Extension:
- **Preserves ambiguity** - Vague inputs produce accurate (if vague) outputs
- **Prevents hallucinations** - AI can't invent features
- **Blocks only when needed** - Asks questions only if documentation requires invention
- **Maintains terminology** - Uses your exact terms

---

## 📚 Examples

### Example 1: Incomplete Notes

**Your input:**
```
User clicks login. System checks credentials. 
Redirect to dashboard if valid. Show error if not.
Admin users get extra features.
```

**What AI does:**
- Documents it accurately
- Preserves "extra features" (doesn't invent what they are)
- Uses your terminology
- Creates structured procedure

### Example 2: Complete Content

**Your input:**
```
The homepage displays a login form with username 
and password fields. When user clicks the blue 
"Sign In" button, credentials are validated. 
Valid users redirect to /dashboard. Invalid users 
see red error: "Invalid credentials."
```

**What AI does:**
- Preserves exact details (blue button, red error, "/dashboard")
- Uses exact error message text
- Doesn't add "Forgot Password" or other features
- Creates precise documentation

### Example 3: Missing Critical Info

**Your input:**
```
User completes the standard workflow and system 
takes appropriate action.
```

**What AI does:**
- Stops and asks: "What is 'standard workflow'?"
- Asks: "What is 'appropriate action'?"
- Won't invent undefined behaviors

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### ✅ Do:
- Include specific terminology you want preserved
- Mention UI element labels exactly
- Provide error message text when known
- Include relevant technical details

### ❌ Don't:
- Worry about perfect formatting
- Fill in details you don't know
- Clean up rough notes first
- Remove context or background info

**The extension handles ambiguity - you focus on accuracy.**
