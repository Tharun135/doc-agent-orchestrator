Subject: API rate limiting documentation needed

Hi team,

Our API clients are getting rate limited but there's no documentation about the limits. Can you document:
- What the rate limits are
- How they're enforced
- What happens when you hit the limit
- Best practices to avoid hitting it

Current behavior is undocumented and customers are frustrated.

Thanks,
Mike
