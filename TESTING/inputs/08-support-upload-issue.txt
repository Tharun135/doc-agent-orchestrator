## Test Input 08: Support Ticket (User Issue)

**Ticket #4567**

User reports they can't upload files larger than 10MB. Getting error message "Upload failed". 

Tested on Chrome, Windows 10. Same issue on Firefox. Mobile app works fine for same file.

User tried:
- Different file formats (PDF, DOCX, JPG)
- Clearing browser cache
- Different network connection

Still failing on web. Need workaround or fix.
