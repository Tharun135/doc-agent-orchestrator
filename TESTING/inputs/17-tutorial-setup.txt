## Test Input 17: Tutorial (Getting Started)

From: Internal wiki

**Setting up the development environment**

First, install Node.js (recent version should work). Then clone the repo and run the install command. 

You'll need to configure environment variables - check the example file for what's needed. Some are optional.

Run the dev server to verify everything works. It should start on a port and open automatically.

If you see errors, try the troubleshooting section. Most issues are related to dependencies or config.
