## Test Input 20: Architecture Concept (Microservices)

From: Design doc - Service Communication

Our system uses event-driven architecture. Services communicate through message queue with eventual consistency.

**Key services:**
- User service: Handles authentication and profiles
- Payment service: Processes transactions
- Notification service: Sends alerts via various channels

When a user action happens, the originating service publishes an event. Other services subscribe to relevant events and react accordingly.

Failed messages go to retry queue with exponential backoff. After certain attempts, they move to dead letter queue for investigation.

This provides loose coupling and better scalability compared to direct calls.
