## Test Input 21: Security Troubleshooting

**Report:** Users seeing "Invalid Token" errors intermittently

**Context:**
- Started happening after the latest deployment
- Affects approximately 10-15% of users
- More common during peak hours
- Token validation seems to fail randomly

**Investigation so far:**
- Logs show tokens are valid but fail verification
- Clock skew suspected
- May be related to load balancer configuration
- Token expiry might need adjustment

**Temporary workaround:** Users can re-authenticate to get fresh token
